This phenomenon could be recognized as a Version control system.")
print("Version control system is where the changes/inputs by all the members of the team are recorded in the branches which are then approved by a pull request and aligned into the main branch for final output. For instance, in a group of coders, The lead coder/ employer will keep track of all the branches where all other branches are maintained by employees to provide their inputs. These inputs will later be approved by the employer to merge with the main branch, which could be the main project.")
